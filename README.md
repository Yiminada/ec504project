# EC504 Project: Comparing Algorithms to Solve the Vehicle Routing Problem
> Yang Lu, Antonio Alonso, Christopher Gough, Yimin Xu

## How to Run the Code
### Requirements
Ensure you have a recent version (3.6 or higher) of Python installed. We have provided sample data to use for testing the algorithms; if you wish to test on your own, ensure it's properly formatted as a CSV. You'll also have to change the file name on line 88 of `VRP_alg.py`. You'll also need to set up a virtual environment to install the necessary dependencies.
> You don't _need_ to, but for the sake of keeping your PC clean and organized, you really should.

It's very simple. Run the following (for Mac/Linux distros):
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install plotly
```
If you're on a Windows machine, activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/Scripts/Activate`.  To deactivate (on any OS) run `deactivate`.

### Running the Code
We've configured the algorithms to run and print their outputs from a single entrypoint. In the project folder, simply run `python VRP_alg.py`.
